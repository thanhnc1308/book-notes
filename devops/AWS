on-demand, scalable compute services without the burden of building and maintining their own hardware and data centers

on-demand, IT resources, accessable online, pay as you go

AWS vs On-Premise
- avoid large capital expenses. no upfront investment
- reduce on-going IT costs. multiple pricing options. on-premise requires upgrades on 1-3-5 year cycles. cost of labor and sys addmin
- no need to predict the amount of computing resourses. low on-going costs
- elastic scalability
- deploy apps in any regions --> low latency. global reach on demand
- speed and agility

# Infrastructure
- Security: Security groups, NACLs, Access Mgmt
- Network: ELB, VPC
- Servers: EC2
- Storage and db: EBS, S3, RDS

- region is a georaphic area with 2 or more Availability Zones. choose a region where your data will be stored -> ooptimize latency
- AZ: collection of data centers within a region. Each is isolated from other AZ and is connected by a fast low latency link. represented by a region code: us-east-1a
- edge locations host a content delivery network CDN called CloudFront. --> deliver websites and content that is dynamic, static, or streaming. request for content are auto routed to the neartest edge location to speed up
- use multiple AZ to protect against interruptions and CloudFront ensure web pages load quickly


- EC2: virtual servers that have remote access
- use AWS Management Console or AWS API
