The docker-compose stop command will stop your containers, but it won’t remove them.

The docker-compose down command will stop your containers, but it also removes the stopped containers as well as any networks that were created.

You can take down 1 step further and add the -v flag to remove all volumes too. This is great for doing a full blown reset on your environment by running docker-compose down -v

docker stop project_nginx_run_1 

docker ps -a -q --filter="name=<containerName>"

docker rm $(docker stop $(docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=<image-name> --format="{{.ID}}"))

docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=<image-name> )

docker stop — Stops one or more containers. docker stop my_container stops one container, while docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) stops all running containers. A more direct way is to use docker kill my_container, which does not attempt to shut down the process gracefully first.

docker logs — Use this command to display the logs of a container, you must specify a container and can use flags, such as --follow to follow the output in the logs of using the program. docker logs --follow my_container
docker volume ls — This lists the volumes, which are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

kill all running containers with docker kill $(docker ps -q)
delete all stopped containers with docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
delete all images with docker rmi $(docker images -q)
